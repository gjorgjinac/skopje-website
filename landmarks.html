                 The statue and fountain "Warrior on a horse"
                is probably the most symbolic one for Skopje as a part of the reconstruction project called "Skopje 2014".
                It is typically thought to depict Alexander the Great, though it is not officially named after him.
                The bronze sculpture is the tallest one on the Balkan peninsula [14.5 m]  and consists of three large ivory sections, each separated by a thinner bronze ring.
                The column stands in a fountain. At the base of the column are 8 bronze soldiers, 8 bronze lions,
                around the edges of the fountain pool, four of which act as part of the fountain,
                releasing water from their mouths.

                <br>
                The Stone Bridge is a bridge across the Vardar River, which connects Macedonia Square to the Old Bazaar.
                The bridge is considered a symbol of Skopje and is the main element of the coat of arms of the city,
                which in turn is incorporated in the city's flag. The Stone Bridge is built of solid stone blocks and is supported by
                firm columns that are connected with 12 semicircular arcs. The bridge is 214 m (702 ft) long and 6 m (20 ft) wide.
                 The current Stone Bridge was built on Roman foundations under the patronage
                of Sultan Mehmed II the Conqueror between 1451 and 1469. Throughout the centuries, the Stone Bridge was often damaged and
                then repaired. The last reconstruction of the bridge began in 1994.
                The watchtower shaped like a mihrab was reconstructed in 2008.
Some executions have also taken place on this bridge, such as the execution of Karposh in 1689.

Although Ottoman architecture is predominant, remains of Byzantine architecture are evident as well, while recent reconstructions have led to the application of elements specific to modern architecture. The Old Bazaar still is home to several active mosques, türbes, two churches and a clocktower, that, together with the buildings of the Museum of Macedonia and the Museum of Modern Art, form the core of the modern bazaar.

Scholars believe that the fortress was constructed under the orders of Byzantine Emperor Justinian I, who had been born in the nearby city of Tauresium.
          At the beginning of XX century until 1953 the fortress had a military-strategic function. Therefore, at the bottom
                of the hill were built 15 shelters. In 1953 the army was moved and the fortress lost its military-strategic position
                in topographical terms, but this feature continues to exist regarding the shelter.
Skopje fortress "Kale" has two defensive belts and built structures out of the defensive belts in which fits an enclosed
                wall i.e. "Water Tower". The interior has remains of several buildings from different periods.

               <p class="titles"> The Skopje Aqueduct</p>
The Skopje Aqueduct, located north of the city center, is the largest of the three preserved buildings of its kind on the Balkan Peninsula.
                  Assumptions about the time of construction is moving in a time frame of the first half of VI century
                  (the Byzantine emperor Jusitinajan) to the XVI century (when in Skopje were built nearly all
                  baths and the city had a constant need for large water supply). It is assumed it was still in use at the end of XIX century.

The lower part of the Aqueduct consists of 53 square or rectangular pillars and 2 lateral ramps -
                  north and south, with their foundations.The frontal walls are of mixed masonry, stone and brick in lime mortar,
                  with archivoltes and external arches of brick. The façade screens on both sides end up with a chain of brick,
                  over which there is a longitudinal walling also of mixed masonry.
